RegTest-HTML
============

A [RegTest](https://eblong.com/zarf/plotex/regtest.html) compatible test framework for HTML interpreters, using [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/).

Full support for all of RegTest's options is not yet implemented; if there is something in particular you want, please [raise an issue to request it](https://github.com/curiousdannii/regtest-html/issues). But note that some options won't be added as they aren't meaningful, such as RemGlk mode.

RegTest-HTML has been designed for [GlkOte](https://github.com/erkyrath/glkote) based interpreters, but it could be adapted for other HTML interpreters. Again, please [raise an issue to discuss](https://github.com/curiousdannii/regtest-html/issues).
